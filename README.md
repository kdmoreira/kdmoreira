### Hi there 👋

“It is not enough for code to work.”
– _Robert C. Martin_

As a Software Engineer I work towards both learning and putting into practice what the quote above encompasses.

- 🔭 At Nubank I'm part of a team that builds internal testing and productivity tools. Before that, I used to work as a .NET back-end developer building APIs for microservices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about functional programming, TDD, distributed systems, message brokers and Docker.

- ⚡ Fun fact: besides programming, I like history, casual board games and making digital art.
