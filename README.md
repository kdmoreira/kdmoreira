### Hi there 👋

“It is not enough for code to work.”
– _Robert C. Martin_

As a Software Engineer I work towards both learning and putting into practice what the quote above encompasses.

- 🔭 I work at Nubank, in a platform team that uses mostly Clojure to build productivity and testing tools for other teams, providing better developer experience and safer continuous delivery. Before that, I used to work as a back-end .NET developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud computing and distributed systems.

- ⚡ Fun fact: besides programming, I like history, casual board games and making digital art.
